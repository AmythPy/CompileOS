# âœ… Desktop Build Fixes Applied!

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Window Structure Self-Reference
**Error:**
```
warning: initialization of 'window_t *' from incompatible pointer type 'struct window *'
error: invalid use of undefined type 'struct window'
```

**Problem:**
The struct was using `struct window*` for next/prev pointers but was typedef'd as `window_t` without a tag name.

**Fix in desktop.h:**
```c
// Before:
typedef struct {
    ...
    struct window* next;
    struct window* prev;
} window_t;

// After:
typedef struct window_t {
    ...
    struct window_t* next;
    struct window_t* prev;
} window_t;
```

### 2. Memory Allocation Functions
**Error:**
```
warning: implicit declaration of function 'malloc'
warning: implicit declaration of function 'free'
```

**Fix in desktop.c:**
```c
// Before:
window_t* window = (window_t*)malloc(sizeof(window_t));
free(window);

// After:
window_t* window = (window_t*)memory_alloc(sizeof(window_t));
memory_free(window);
```
