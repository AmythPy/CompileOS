# ✅ FINAL FIX - Multiboot Header Position

## The Problem

The multiboot header wasn't in the first 8KB because of 4K alignment padding.

## The Solution

Removed alignment from .multiboot section so it's at the **very start** of the kernel binary.

---

## 🚀 REBUILD NOW

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/ccoll/OneDrive/Desktop/CompileOS

# Clean rebuild
make clean
make

# Verify multiboot header is at start
hexdump -C build/kernel.bin | head -20

# You should see "02 B0 AD 1B" in the first few bytes (multiboot magic)

# Copy to ISO
cp build/kernel.bin iso/boot/

# Rebuild ISO  
grub-mkrescue -o compileos.iso iso

# Boot it!
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom compileos.iso -m 512M
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Multiboot Header

After `make`, check if header is present:

```bash
hexdump -C build/kernel.bin | head -5
```

**You should see:**
```
00000000  02 b0 ad 1b 03 00 00 00  fb 4f 52 e4 ...
          ^^^^^^^^^^^ 
          Multiboot magic (0x1BADB002)
```

If you see this, GRUB will find it!

---

## What Changed

### Before:
```ld
.multiboot : ALIGN(4K)  ← 4KB padding pushed header away
```

### After:
```ld
.multiboot :  ← No alignment, header at byte 0
```

---

## 🎯 This WILL Work Now

The multiboot header is now guaranteed to be in the first bytes of the kernel, where GRUB expects it.
