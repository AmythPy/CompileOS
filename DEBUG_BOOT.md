# 🔍 Debug Boot - What You'll See

## I've Added Debug Messages

The bootloader now prints letters to show progress:

### What Each Letter Means:
- **BB** = Booted successfully (32-bit mode started)
- **CC** = Checking CPU for 64-bit support
- **PP** = Setting up page tables
- **66** = Switched to 64-bit mode
- **KK** = About to call kernel_main()
- **EE** = Error - kernel returned (shouldn't happen)

---

## 🚀 Rebuild and Test

```bash
# Go to directory
cd /mnt/c/Users/ccoll/OneDrive/Desktop/CompileOS

# Rebuild with debug output
make clean && make

# Update ISO
cp build/kernel.bin iso/boot/

# Rebuild ISO
grub-mkrescue -o compileos.iso iso

# Run and watch for letters
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom compileos.iso -m 512M
```

## 📊 What to Look For

### If you see:
- **Just blinking cursor** = Multiboot not loading
- **BB** only = Stuck after boot
- **BBCC** = Stuck checking CPU
- **BBCCPP** = Stuck setting up paging
- **BBCCPP66** = Stuck in 64-bit transition
- **BBCCPP66KK** = Kernel called but not responding
- **BBCCPP66KKEE** = Kernel returned (error)

### If kernel works:
You'll see **BBCCPP66KK** then the screen will clear and show your desktop!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If stuck at BB:
CPU doesn't support 64-bit (unlikely in QEMU)

### If stuck at BBCCPP:
Paging setup failed

### If stuck at BBCCPP66:
64-bit mode transition failed

### If stuck at BBCCPP66KK:
Kernel is running but VGA init might have failed
