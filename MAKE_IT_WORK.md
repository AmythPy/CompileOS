# ðŸ”¥ MAKING COMPILEOS ACTUALLY WORK

## The Problem
CompileOS boots and shows text, but:
- Can't type anything
- Commands don't work
- It's just a static screen

## The Solution
Wire up the existing components:

### Step 1: Initialize HAL properly
The HAL has keyboard support, we just need to call it

### Step 2: Enable interrupts
Keyboard needs interrupts to work

### Step 3: Add input loop
Read keyboard, process commands, show output

### Step 4: Make commands work
Wire up help, version, echo, clear, repl

## Let's implement this NOW!
